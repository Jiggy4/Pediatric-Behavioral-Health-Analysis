# Pediatric Behavioral Health Analysis

## Introduction
This repository contains data analysis, visualizations, and findings from a comprehensive study on pediatric behavioral health trends in Massachusetts and at a national level. The focus is on understanding the mental, emotional, and social well-being of children and adolescents, particularly in relation to screening rates, ADHD, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and bullying.

## Overview
Pediatric behavioral health is critical for the overall development of children, influencing their academic performance, relationships, and future well-being. This analysis provides valuable insights into behavioral health trends and makes data-driven recommendations to improve pediatric health outcomes.

## Objectives
The analysis focuses on understanding the trends in pediatric behavioral health, with an emphasis on screening rates, ADHD, ASD prevalence, and bullying. The study provides data-driven insights to guide interventions and improve outcomes in pediatric behavioral health.

## Tools Used
- **Excel**: For data cleaning, analysis, and calculations.
- **PowerPoint**: For presenting the findings.
- **Power BI**: For data visualization.
  
### Comprehensive Findings

#### Component A: Behavioral Health Screenings
Our approach involved examining the trends by analyzing the percentage of pediatric populations undergoing screening during hospital visits, with a focus on those requiring behavioral health interventions. This analysis covers data from the Mass CBHI behavioral health screenings between 2012 and 2021.

- **Screening Trends in Massachusetts**:
  - The **Western, Central, and Boston regions** exhibited substantial increases in behavioral health screenings, with rises of **12.71%**, **4.8%**, and **5.45%** respectively.
  - Conversely, the **Central Region** witnessed a notable **decrease of 4.11%** in the screening rate, specifically in the percentage of visits incorporating a behavioral health screen.

#### Component B: ADHD, ASD, and Bullying Prevalence
To gain comprehensive insights into the prevalence of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and incidents of bullying, our analysis considered both state-level data in Massachusetts and national trends.

- **National ADHD and ASD Prevalence**:
  - The states of **Louisiana, West Virginia, and New Hampshire** rank among the top 10 for the prevalence of both ADHD and ASD.
  - **Louisiana** has the highest proportion of ADHD prevalence, with **15.7%** of children currently diagnosed.

- **Massachusetts Specific Trends**:
  - Massachusetts ranks **3rd in the United States** for ASD prevalence, with approximately **4%** of the child population diagnosed with ASD.
  - **ADHD** affects around **10%** of children in Massachusetts, placing the state **23rd** nationally in terms of prevalence.
  - Massachusetts is also among the top 5 states with the **lowest rates of bullying**, with about **3.6%** of children experiencing bullying 1-2 times per month.

These findings highlight the need for heightened awareness and collaborative efforts to address the challenges posed by these neurodevelopmental conditions. Understanding and addressing these issues is essential for effective public health interventions and resource allocation.

## Recommendations

- **Pharmacological Interventions**: 
  - Explore pharmaceutical treatments to optimize outcomes in managing ADHD symptoms, focusing on attention improvement and behavioral regulation.

- **Behavioral Therapy**:
  - Implement targeted behavioral therapy to enhance on-task behaviors through positive reinforcement and systematic interventions.

- **Environmental Modifications**:
  - Modify environments to support positive behavior, focusing on the child's strengths while addressing specific areas of concern.

- **Parental Collaboration**:
  - Work with parents to set clear expectations for behavior management and task fulfillment, providing clinical insights for effective intervention.
